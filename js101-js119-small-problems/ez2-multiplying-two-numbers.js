//Create a function that takes two arguments, multiplies them together, and returns the result.

const multiply = (num1, num2) => num1 * num2

console.log(multiply(5, 3) === 15); // logs true

//Since the arrow function has only a single expression as the function body, the resulting value will be returned implicitly when the function is called => block with curly braces not required
